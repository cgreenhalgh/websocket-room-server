# WebSocket Room Server

Chris Greenhalgh, Copyright (c) The University of Nottingham, 2024

Meant to be a simple room-style messageing server to act as the 
live collaboration backbone for
[cardographer](https://github.com/MixedRealityLab/cardographer-platform).

Split into a separate module package to hopefully make it easier
to integrate in both the vite dev and productions builds of 
cardographer.

##Â Requirements

- Run in server only.
- standard websocket interface.
- server creates rooms.
- clients must provide room-specific authentication.
- clients may provide client-specific authentication, visible to server callbacks.
- once authenticated, client messages are visible to server as events.
- server can send messages to a single room client or all room clients.
- server can close a room (ejecting all clients).
- server can eject a single client.
- client connections time out (clients can ping).
